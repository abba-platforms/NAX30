## 3. Benchmark Nature

NAX30 is a blockchain-native benchmark index designed to reference a defined basket of thirty (30) securities listed on the Namibia Securities Exchange (NSX).

NAX30:

- Does not represent ownership in underlying securities  
- Does not constitute equity, debt, or fund units  
- Does not provide dividend entitlement  
- Does not incorporate redemption rights  

The index functions solely as a digital benchmark reference instrument.

---

## 4. Methodology Governance

The NAX30 Index operates under a published and version-controlled methodology document.

The methodology:

- Defines constituent eligibility criteria  
- Defines weighting logic  
- Defines calculation formula  
- Defines corporate action treatment  
- Defines rebalancing procedures  
- Defines market disruption policies  

All methodology changes require:

1. Multi-signature governance approval  
2. Timelock scheduling  
3. On-chain execution  
4. Public documentation update  

Material changes may be publicly disclosed prior to execution where operationally feasible.

---

## 5. Governance Framework

NAX30 governance is structured under a two-layer architecture:

- Multi-Signature Safe (proposal authority)  
- TimelockController (mandatory delay enforcement)  

Governance actions are:

- Publicly auditable  
- Event-emitting  
- Deterministically scheduled  
- Threshold-controlled  

No unilateral authority exists.

Governance does not exercise discretionary authority over calculated index levels.

---

## 6. Determination of Benchmark Level

The NAX30 index level is calculated algorithmically using a defined mathematical formula.

There is:

- No manual override of calculated values  
- No discretionary adjustment of published levels  
- No governance-based price setting  

All index calculations derive from predefined methodology inputs and quorum-confirmed oracle submissions.

---

## 7. Data Integrity & Oracle Controls

Index price inputs are obtained through a quorum-based oracle framework.

The system operates under a 2-of-3 quorum confirmation requirement.

Data validation controls include:

- Timestamp validation  
- Median-based aggregation logic  
- Tolerance thresholds  
- Public on-chain verification  

Oracle configuration changes require governance scheduling.

### Data Hierarchy

Primary Data Source:

- Official Namibia Securities Exchange (NSX) disclosures  

Secondary Sources:

- Validated market reporting systems  

In case of discrepancy, official exchange data prevails.

---

## 8. Transparency Standards

The following documents are publicly available:

- Whitepaper  
- Index Methodology  
- Governance Charter  
- Oracle Policy  
- Smart contract deployment addresses  
- Methodology version history  

All governance actions and upgrades are publicly verifiable on-chain.

---

## 9. Change Control Standards

Material changes to:

- Methodology  
- Governance structure  
- Oracle framework  
- Smart contract logic  

Require:

- Proposal  
- Multi-signature approval  
- Timelock scheduling  
- On-chain execution  

No retroactive structural modifications are permitted.

---

## 10. Conflict of Interest Principle

Governance participants:

- Must avoid conflicts of interest  
- Must not engage in price manipulation  
- Must not interfere with open market trading  
- Must not exercise discretion over index calculation  

NAX30 governance does not influence market pricing mechanisms.

---

## 13. Business Continuity Framework

- Governance-based upgrade controls  

Operational continuity relies on decentralized network infrastructure and governance coordination.
