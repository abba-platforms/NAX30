# NAX30 Administrator Framework  
Namibia 30 Index (NAX30)

Version 2.0 – Institutional Benchmark Administration Framework  
Effective Date: February 2026  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the role, responsibilities, controls, and operational structure of the Benchmark Administrator for the Namibia 30 Index (NAX30).

The objective is to:

- Clarify administrative authority  
- Define governance boundaries  
- Establish operational oversight framework  
- Protect benchmark integrity  
- Separate administrative function from commercial considerations  

This Framework aligns with internationally recognized benchmark governance principles, including IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks, adapted to a blockchain-native infrastructure.

---

## 2. Administrator Identity

As of the Effective Date, the Benchmark Administrator is:

Abba Payments Namibia (Pty) Ltd.  
Co.Reg.No.: 2023/0770  
Headquartered in Oshakati, Namibia  

The Administrator may designate successors or delegates through formal governance procedures.

The Administrator does not act as custodian of underlying NSX-listed securities and does not manage investment portfolios.

---

## 3. Core Responsibilities

The Administrator is responsible for:

- Maintaining and publishing index methodology  
- Overseeing Index Committee operations  
- Managing governance execution (Safe + Timelock)  
- Ensuring documentation transparency  
- Coordinating oracle framework oversight  
- Maintaining public repository disclosures  
- Managing regulatory positioning updates  

The Administrator does not manage investment portfolios or custody underlying securities.

Benchmark integrity and methodological consistency take precedence over commercial, liquidity, or token distribution considerations.

---

## 4. Governance Structure

NAX30 governance operates through:

- Multi-Signature Safe (proposal authority)  
- TimelockController (mandatory execution delay)  
- On-chain Registry (weights & constituents)  

All structural changes require:

1. Governance proposal  
2. Safe approval  
3. Timelock scheduling  
4. On-chain execution  

No unilateral override authority exists.

All governance actions are publicly auditable via blockchain records.

---

## 5. Separation from Commercial Functions

The Administrator shall maintain strict separation between:

- Benchmark methodology decisions  
- Token issuance decisions  
- Exchange listing activities  
- Market-making arrangements  
- OTC allocation processes  

Commercial revenue considerations shall not influence benchmark composition, weighting, rebalancing, or methodology decisions.

Preservation of benchmark integrity supersedes exchange relationships, token liquidity considerations, or commercial incentives.

---

## 6. Independence Firewall

Administrative decision-making must be insulated from:

- Token trading performance  
- Exchange listing negotiations  
- OTC allocation targets  
- Liquidity provisioning arrangements  

Where a potential conflict arises, the Conflict of Interest Policy governs disclosure and resolution.

The Index Committee may override Administrator proposals if benchmark integrity concerns arise.

---

## 7. Operational Controls

Administrative safeguards include:

- Multi-signature governance controls  
- Timelock-based execution delay  
- Public on-chain transparency  
- Version-controlled documentation  
- Conflict-of-interest policy adherence  
- Responsible disclosure framework  
- Internal change management procedures  

Operational decisions are logged and subject to version traceability.

---

## 8. Internal Control Environment

The Administrator maintains internal controls over:

- Governance proposal initiation  
- Registry modification procedures  
- Oracle configuration updates  
- Smart contract upgrade scheduling  

Segregation of duties applies to governance proposal initiation and approval where operationally feasible.

All sensitive changes require multi-signature threshold approval.

---

## 9. Oversight & Accountability

The Administrator operates subject to:

- Index Committee oversight  
- Governance contract constraints  
- Public on-chain auditability  
- Published methodology limitations  

The Index Committee retains authority over methodological interpretation and extraordinary adjustment decisions.

---

## 10. Conflict Escalation Framework

If the Administrator itself is subject to a conflict:

1. Disclosure must be recorded.
2. The Index Committee shall review.
3. Governance execution may be delayed.
4. External advisory consultation may be obtained if necessary.

Conflicted parties must abstain from related governance votes.

---

## 11. Record Retention

The Administrator maintains records of:

- Governance proposals  
- Methodology revisions  
- Rebalancing decisions  
- Oracle changes  
- Smart contract upgrades  
- Committee decisions  

On-chain records are permanent.

Off-chain documentation is retained for a minimum of five (5) years or longer if required by applicable regulation.

---

## 12. Business Continuity

The Administrator operates in coordination with the published Business Continuity Plan (BCP).

During disruption events, the Administrator shall prioritize:

- Data integrity  
- Calculation stability  
- Governance security  
- Transparent public communication  

Emergency actions must follow governance procedures.

---

## 13. Regulatory Cooperation

The Administrator will cooperate with lawful regulatory inquiries within applicable jurisdictional constraints.

If regulatory directives conflict with governance mechanics, legal review will determine appropriate course of action.

Regulatory classification of NAX30 may evolve over time.

---

## 14. Removal & Replacement of Administrator
