Namibia 30 Index (NAX30)

Version 2.0 – Tier-1 Institutional Benchmark Administrator Standard  
Effective Date: February 2026  

---

## 1. Purpose

This Conflict of Interest Policy establishes the framework for identifying, disclosing, mitigating, documenting, and managing actual or potential conflicts of interest in the administration and governance of the Namibia 30 Index (NAX30).

The objective of this Policy is to safeguard the integrity, independence, neutrality, and credibility of the NAX30 benchmark.

---

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to:

- Benchmark Administrator  
- Governance signers (Multi-Signature Safe participants)  
- Oracle operators  
- Index Oversight Committee members (if applicable)  
- Registry administrators  
- Any party involved in index methodology, data submission, governance execution, or smart contract upgrades  

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

NAX30 governance and administration operate under the following principles:

- Market neutrality  
- Independence from constituent issuers  
- Non-interference with price formation  
- Separation of duties  
- Transparency of structural changes  
- Deterministic benchmark calculation  

Benchmark administration shall not be influenced by commercial, trading, investment, or token price considerations.

---

## 4. Identification of Conflicts

Conflicts of interest may arise where a covered individual or entity:

- Has a financial interest in a constituent security  
- Engages in trading activity linked to NAX30  
- Holds material NAX30 token exposure  
- Has a material relationship with a constituent issuer  
- Receives compensation tied to benchmark performance  
- Exercises discretionary authority over governance decisions  
- Has access to non-public governance proposals  

All covered participants are required to proactively identify potential conflicts.

---

## 5. Disclosure Requirements

Covered individuals must promptly disclose:

- Material financial interests in constituent securities  
- Material NAX30 token holdings  
- Material relationships with constituent issuers  
- Compensation arrangements that may create bias  
- Any other circumstance that could impair independence  

Disclosures must be submitted to the Benchmark Administrator.

Failure to disclose material conflicts may result in removal from governance participation.

---

## 6. Conflict Register

The Benchmark Administrator shall maintain a Conflict Register.

The Register will document:

- Nature of disclosed conflict  
- Date of disclosure  
- Mitigation measures applied  
- Recusal decisions  
- Governance actions taken  

Records shall be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.

---

## 7. Attestation Requirement

All governance signers, oracle operators, and Oversight Committee members must:

- Review this Policy upon appointment  
- Provide written or recorded attestation acknowledging understanding and agreement  
- Confirm ongoing compliance annually  

Failure to provide attestation may result in suspension.

---

## 8. Mitigation Measures

Where a conflict is identified, mitigation actions may include:

- Recusal from governance vote  
- Temporary suspension of signer authority  
- Removal from oracle operator role  
- Public disclosure of conflict  
- Replacement of affected governance participant  

Removal or replacement requires formal governance procedure (Safe approval and timelock scheduling), except where emergency authority is explicitly defined in smart contract logic.

---

## 9. Trading Restriction & Cooling-Off Policy

Governance signers and oracle operators must not:

- Trade NAX30 tokens or constituent securities based on non-public governance information  
- Trade during active rebalancing review windows where non-public changes are pending  
- Trade during oracle reconfiguration periods involving structural adjustments  

Where material governance proposals are pending but not yet publicly scheduled via timelock, participants must refrain from trading activities that could reasonably be perceived as exploiting privileged information.

---

## 10. Confidential Information Handling

Non-public governance proposals, oracle changes, or structural modifications must be treated as confidential until:

- Formally scheduled via timelock  
- Publicly documented in the repository  

Selective disclosure of non-public structural changes is prohibited.

---

## 11. Structural Safeguards

NAX30 incorporates structural safeguards to reduce conflict risk:

- Multi-signature governance (no unilateral authority)  
- Timelock-enforced execution delay  
- Oracle quorum confirmation (2-of-3 requirement)  
- Deterministic algorithmic index calculation  
- On-chain transparency of governance actions  

No individual participant can independently alter index levels.

---

## 12. Prohibited Conduct

The following conduct is strictly prohibited:

- Manipulating index methodology for financial gain  
- Influencing oracle submissions for trading advantage  
- Coordinating governance actions to impact market pricing  
- Selective disclosure of pending governance changes  
- Front-running structural adjustments  
- Compensation arrangements tied directly to index performance  

Violations may result in removal from governance participation.

---

## 13. Compensation Neutrality

Compensation of governance participants, if any, must not be:

- Tied to index level performance  
- Tied to NAX30 market price  
- Tied to trading volume  
- Structured to incentivize directional bias  

Compensation structures must preserve independence.

---

## 14. Related-Party Relationships

Material commercial or contractual relationships between the Benchmark Administrator and constituent issuers must be disclosed internally and evaluated for conflict risk.

Where a material relationship could impair benchmark independence, mitigation measures must be implemented.

---

## 15. Escalation Procedure

If a conflict is disputed or unresolved:

1. Matter is reviewed by the Benchmark Administrator  
2. Documentation is recorded in Conflict Register  
3. Governance review may be initiated  
4. Where appropriate, Oversight Committee advisory review may occur  

All escalation outcomes must be documented.

---

## 16. Monitoring & Annual Review

The Benchmark Administrator shall:

- Periodically review governance participation  
- Assess conflict disclosures  
- Update Conflict Register  
- Review effectiveness of mitigation procedures  

An annual review of this Policy may be conducted.

---

## 17. Regulatory Positioning

This Policy supports alignment with high-level international benchmark governance standards, including alignment with IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.

Regulatory interpretation may vary by jurisdiction.

---

## 18. Amendments

This Policy may be amended only through:

1. Governance proposal  
2. Multi-signature approval  
3. Timelock scheduling  
4. On-chain execution  

All amendments must be version-controlled and archived.

---

## 19. Disclaimer

It does not create fiduciary duties beyond defined governance roles and does not constitute investment advice.
