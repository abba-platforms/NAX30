## 2. Structural Overview

NAX30 is a blockchain-native digital benchmark token designed to reference a rules-based basket of thirty (30) selected securities listed on the Namibia Securities Exchange (NSX).

NAX30:

- Does not represent ownership in underlying securities  
- Does not provide dividend entitlement  
- Does not convey voting rights  
- Does not represent debt obligation  
- Does not entitle holders to claim underlying assets  

The instrument represents digital benchmark exposure only.

## 3. Non-Redeemable Structure

NAX30 has:

- No redemption mechanism  
- No asset-backed reserve  
- No custody of underlying equities  
- No NAV redemption framework  

Token market price is determined solely by supply-demand dynamics.

There is no arbitrage mechanism enforcing convergence to theoretical index value.

---

## 4. Fixed Supply & Governance-Controlled Issuance

NAX30 operates under:

- Fixed maximum supply (10,000,000,000 tokens)  
- Governance-controlled mint authority  
- Timelock-based execution controls  

There is no algorithmic inflation or automatic issuance schedule.

Issuance decisions are administrative and not linked to underlying asset acquisition.

## 5. Comparison to Traditional Instruments

NAX30 is structurally distinct from:

### 5.1 Equity Securities
It does not represent share capital or ownership interest.

### 5.2 Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
It does not hold underlying securities and offers no redemption at NAV.
